            Contains navigation and the logo. The <header> and <nav> tags aren't strictly necessary
            but are a good practice for describing the semantic meaning of elements on your site. I 
            mentioned semantics quite a bit during our class; look up "semantic HTML" online for a
            bunch of opinionated articles (both in favor and against!) about the value of semantic
            HTML.

            In my humble opinion, designing websites using semantic HTML is the right path for 
            future-proofing your designs. It's *not* worth stressing out about whether you should be
            using a <header>, <div>, <section>, etc for a long time but if there's an obvious semantic
            tag that's more specific that a standard <div>, go for it.

             nested inside of it are inline-block's. #content occupies the full horizontal space of the document, and
             the columns fit beside each other horizontally. -->

                A figure, like <header>, <footer>, and <nav>, is another grouping element that usually contains
                an image and a caption. More info here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure.
                In class we used a <div>, but <figure> is more semantically correct. Ultimately not a huge deal if you
                use one or the other.

            We didn't cover this in class, but this is a small taste of some Javascript that make the
            button actually do something. You can read this code as: 
                "Find the element with an ID of 'sprinkles.' Any time that someone clicks on that element,
                change the display type of the element with ID 'sprinkles-img' to 'block' instead of 'none.'"
            The #sprinkles-img image starts off being invisible (display: none) but this code makes it
            visible when the button is pressed. If you're interested in learning more about Javascript,
            come to one of our Javascript crash courses! There are also a ton of online courses and online
            walkthroughs.
